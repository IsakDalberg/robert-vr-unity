## 🎮 Project Overview

This Unity VR project serves as an immersive interface to interact with **R.O.B.E.R.T PRIME**, a robotics system built on Raspberry Pi, LEGO components, and AI-powered vision and speech.  
The VR interface allows users to:

- Monitor real-time data from R.O.B.E.R.T
- Interact via a virtual control dashboard
- Visualize robot feedback (camera, sensors, speech) in VR

The **PRIME** version merges the robot's API and dashboard into a single unified system—now accessible via VR.
